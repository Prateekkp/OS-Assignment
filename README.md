## 🧩 Assignment 1 — Process Management in Linux
**Objective:** Understand process creation, execution, and management using system calls.  

### **Included Tasks:**
1. **Creating and Managing Processes:** Using `fork()` to create multiple child processes.  
2. **Executing External Commands:** Using `exec()` to run commands like `ls -l`.  
3. **Special Process States:** Demonstrating **Zombie** and **Orphan** processes.  
4. **Process Information Access:** Reading process details from the **`/proc` filesystem**.  
5. **Process Priority Management:** Adjusting CPU scheduling priority using the **`nice`** command.  

📄 **Files Included:**  
- `process_management.py`  
- `output.txt`  
- `OS_Lab_Assignment 1.docx`  
- `Assignment - OS_Report.pdf`  
- `Task 1 & 2.png`, `Task 3.png`, `Task 4 & 5.png`, `Task 5.png`

## 💾 Assignment 3 — Advanced OS Concepts: Scheduling & Memory Management
**Objective:** Extend understanding of OS by implementing **scheduling and memory allocation** strategies.

### **Included Tasks:**
1. **Task 1 — Scheduling Algorithm Implementation**  
   - Simulate basic process scheduling using Python.  
4. **Task 4 — Memory Allocation Strategies**  
   - Simulate **Best-Fit**, **Worst-Fit**, and **First-Fit** memory allocation.  
5. **Task 5 — MFT and MVT Simulation**  
   - Implement **Multiprogramming with Fixed Tasks (MFT)** and **Variable Tasks (MVT)** strategies.  

📄 **Files Included:**  
- `task1_scheduling.py`  
- `task4_memory_allocation.py`
